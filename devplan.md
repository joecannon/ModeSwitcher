# Development Plan for ModeSwitcher

## 1. Improve Error Handling
- Add more robust error handling in `AutoLaunch.swift` and `DarkModeManager.swift`.
- Provide better feedback to users when something goes wrong (e.g., permission issues or missing files).

## 2. Add Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for key components like `DarkModeManager` and `AutoLaunch` to ensure reliability and catch regressions.

## 3. Improve AppleScript Execution
- Use the `osascript` command-line tool as a fallback if `NSAppleScript` fails to execute the script.

## 4. Optimize AutoLaunch
- Check if the app is already running before creating a new `LaunchAgent` plist to avoid redundant processes.

## 5. Add Logging
- Implement a logging mechanism to track app events and errors for debugging purposes.

## 6. Add Preferences Menu
- Implement a preferences menu to allow users to configure settings, such as:
  - Automatically launching the app at login (toggle for `AutoLaunch`).
  - Customizing the icons for dark and light modes.

## 7. Enhance Status Bar Icon
- Add support for custom icons or themes for the status bar icon.
- Provide a tooltip or hover text for the status bar icon to indicate the current mode.

## 8. Add Keyboard Shortcuts
- Allow users to toggle dark mode or quit the app using customizable keyboard shortcuts.

## 9. Add a Timer Feature
- Allow users to schedule automatic toggling of dark mode based on time (e.g., sunrise/sunset).

## 10. Localization
- Add support for multiple languages by localizing strings in the app (e.g., "Quit" menu item, error messages).

## 11. Add a Help Section
- Include a "Help" menu or documentation to guide users on how to use the app and troubleshoot common issues.

## 12. Refactor Code
- Refactor the codebase to improve readability and maintainability:
  - Use dependency injection for better testability.
  - Break down large methods into smaller, reusable functions.

## 13. Support for macOS Updates
- Test the app on the latest macOS versions to ensure compatibility.
- Update the `Info.plist` to include the latest macOS-specific keys if necessary.

## 14. Distribute the App
- Package the app for distribution using tools like `Xcode` or `swift build`.
- Sign the app with a developer certificate and notarize it for macOS Gatekeeper.

## 15. Add CI/CD Pipeline
- Set up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate testing and building the app.
